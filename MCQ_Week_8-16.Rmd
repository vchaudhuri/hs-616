## Lecture 8a 


What is the difference between Principal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory Factor analysis (EFA)


* PCA is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger
number of correlated variables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables  and EFA is a technique to uncover the latent structure in a given set of variables
* PCA is a data expansion technique that transforms a smaller
number of  variables into a much larger set of correlated variables  and EFA is a technique to uncover the explore the underlying factors in a data set
* PCA and EFA are essentially the same technique of data reduction technique to find correlated patterns among different variables.
*PCA is a  technique to choose selective variables which matter in the data and compute the correlation in data only among those vraiables and EFA is a technique to extract linear relationship between all variables.
