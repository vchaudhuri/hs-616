## Lecture 8a 


What is the difference between Principal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory Factor analysis (EFA)


* PCA is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger
number of correlated variables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables  and EFA is a technique to uncover the latent structure in a given set of variables
* PCA is a data expansion technique that transforms a smaller
number of  variables into a much larger set of correlated variables  and EFA is a technique to uncover the explore the underlying factors in a data set
* PCA and EFA are essentially the same technique of data reduction technique to find correlated patterns among different variables.
* PCA is a  technique to choose selective variables which matter in the data and compute the correlation in data only among those vraiables and EFA is a technique to extract linear relationship between all variables.

## Lecture 8b

What is the most common criteria to decide which components to retain in PCA

* Selecting the number of components to retain by examining the eigenvalues of the k  correlation matrix among the variables 
* Selecting the number of components needed to account for some threshold cumulative amount of variance in the variables (for example, 80%) 
* Basing the number of components on existing knowledge that affects the data
* Scree plot: this is a graphical method in which you choose the factors until a break in the graph

## Lecture 9a

In the following chunk of code

```
library(ggplot2)
d=data.frame(beauty=c(1,2,6,4,4,6,7,8), intelligence=c(8,4,7,5,4,9,2,3), speed=c(7,6,9,5,7,6,7,8), gender=c('m','m','f','m','f','f','f','m'))
ggplot() + 
scale_size_continuous(to=c(4,12)) +
geom_point(data=d, mapping=aes(x=intelligence, y=beauty, shape=gender, color=gender, size=speed)) +
opts(title="geom_point", plot.title=theme_text(size=40, vjust=1.5))

```
Which feature is defined by scale_size_continuous in ggplot?

* Used to define the range of point sizes to use.
* Used for marking the scale of x and y axis at continuous intervals
* Used to define degrees of aesthetic scores.
* Used to size discrete variables

## Lecture 9 b

What does the corrgram package do?
* Calculates correlation of variables and displays the results graphically.
* Tabulates  a correlation matrix and plots a kernel denisty map
* Draws a boxplot of the  most correlated variables with independent variable
* Draws a heat map of the data
