## Lecture 1a

Which symbol is used as the assignment operator in R

* `<-`
* `<--`
* `==`
* `->`

## Lecture 1b

In the following code, would decreasing the value of N from 10000 to 100 change the shape of the plot significantly (keeping pch constant ) or changing the pch value from 16 to 6 (keeping N at 10000) from the original plot

```
N <- 10000
x <- runif(N, min=-1.0, max=1.0)
y <- runif(N, min=-1.0, max=1.0)
plot(x, y, pch=16, col=ifelse(x^2 + y^2<1, "red", "blue"))
```

* neither will effect shape of the plot
* both will significantly change the shape of plot
* decreasing N will change the shape of the plot
* decreasing pch will change the shape of the plot
