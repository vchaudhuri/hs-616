## Lecture 1a

Which symbol is used as the assignment operator in R

* `<-`
* `<--`
* `==`
* `->`

## Lecture 1b

In the following code, would decreasing the value of N from 10000 to 100 change the shape of the plot significantly (keeping pch constant ) or changing the pch value from 16 to 6 (keeping N at 10000) from the original plot

```
N <- 10000
x <- runif(N, min=-1.0, max=1.0)
y <- runif(N, min=-1.0, max=1.0)
plot(x, y, pch=16, col=ifelse(x^2 + y^2< 1, "red", "blue"))
```


 *  Decreasing N will change the shape of the plot

 *  Both will significantly change the shape of plot

 *  Neither will change the shape of the plot

 *  Decreasing pch will change the shape of the plot

## Lecture 2a

In a screening test would decreasing the sensitivity by 2% ( if we take original sensitivity at 98% then  new sensitivity is 96%) and increasing specificity by 2% i,e original specificity is 95% and new specificty is 97% have an impact on predicting a true positive . Prevalence remains same at 0.001 in both conditions. Use the code below

```
post_probability <- function(sensitivity, specificity, prevalence)
sensitivity*prevalence/(sensitivity*prevalence + (1-specificity)*(1-prevalence))

```
* The probability of predicting a true positive will increase
* The probability of predicting a true positive will decrease
* The probability will remain unchanged
* Cannot decipher any inference from the given parameters

## Lecture 2b

Which of the following distribution is a  discrete probability mass function

*  Bernoulli distribution, which takes value 1 with probability p and value 0 with probability q = 1 − p.
*The Logitnormal distribution on (0,1).
*The rectangular distribution is a uniform distribution on [−1/2,1/2].
* The Beta distribution on [0,1], a family of two-parameter distributions with one mode, of which the uniform distribution is a special case, and which is useful in estimating success probabilities.

## Lecture 3a

If A <- matrix(c(3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 5), nrow=2)
B <- t(A). which choice is correct in the order of stating the dimensions of the following matrices
```
dim(A)
dim(B)
A%*% B
B%*%A
```
```
* 2*3,3*2,2*2,3*3
* 3*2,2*3,3*3,2*2
* 2*2,3*3,2*3,3*2
* 3*3,2*2,3*2,2*3
```

## Lecture 3b
Consider the eigen equation
If A is the identity matrix. what is lambda?

* lamba is equal to 1
* lambda is infinity
* lambda is zero value
* lamda  doesn't exist for an identity matrix
