## Lecture 1a
  
What is the type of variable 'd' below 

```
f <- sqrt
x <- 1:20
y <- f(x)
z <- x^2
d <- data.frame(x, y, z)
```


* list
* matrix
* integer
* character


## Lecture 1b

Consider the following code:What appears to be  the correct output of the [head(as.integer(in_circle))] ?

```
N <-10000
x <- runif(N)
y <- runif(N)
vlength<-sqrt<-(x^2 +y^2)
in_circle<-vlength < 1
```

* 1 1 1 1 1 0
* TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 
* 1 -1 1 0 -1 0
* 0.23, ,0.34, 0.12, 0.45, 0.55, 0.79


## Lecture 2a

What does the Central Limit Theorem state ?

* The distribution of the means of a set of random samples is approximately Normal
* The area under the normal denisty curve is one
* Measures of central tendency should always be computed with and without outliers
* Confidence intervals have zero margin of error for large sample sizes.


## Lecture 2b

Probability mass function is same as probability density function. what type of functions are they?

* False, the probability mass function is a discrete distribution and the probability density function is a continuous distribution
* True, they both are continuous distribution
* True, they both are discrete distribution
* False, the probability mass function is a continuous distribution and the probability density function is a discrete distribution


## Lecture 3a

In the following code . What is the result and typeof  [A%*%t(A)]
```
A <- matrix(1:4, nrow=1)
```

* 5 and integer
* (2X2) matrix and list
* A^2 and double
* A(inv) and integer


## Lecture 3b

Consider the eigen equation
If A is the identity matrix. what is lambda?

* lamba is equal to 1
* lambda is infinity
* lambda is zero value
* lamda  doesn't exist for an identity matrix

## Lecture 4a

Consider the following code:All the below lines of code perform the same function but have different levels of bracket or curly braces. would it affect the performance cost and which will be the fastest ? 
(Hint: R treats curly brackets as a “special” operator, whose arguments are not automatically evaluated, but it treats parentheses as a “built in” operator whose arguments (just one for parentheses) are evaluated automatically, with the results of this evaluation stored in a  list)

```
a <- function(x) x = 1/{
    1 + x
}
f <- function(x) x = 1/(1 + x)
g <- function(x) x = (1/(1 + x))
h <- function(x) x = ((1/(1 + x)))

x <- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)
comp <- microbenchmark(a(x), f(x), g(x), h(x), times = 1e+05)
comp
```

* 'a' will be the fastest because it has curly braces
* 'f' will be fastest because it has paranthesis
* all the operations have the same time because it is the same function and braces or parnatheses does not matter
* 'h' will be fastest because you are simplifying the function by adding layers of parantheses


## Lecture 4b

Consider the following code  does mean1 and mean2 have equal run times or differ in run times? 

```
mean1 <- function(x) mean(x)
mean2 <- function(x) sum(x) / length(x)
x <- runif(100)
stopifnot(all.equal(mean1(x), mean2(x)))
microbenchmark(
  mean1(x),
  mean2(x)
)
```

* mean1 is considerably slower  because  mean1 makes two passes over the vector to be more numerically accurate
* mean2 is considerably faster because just one inbuilt fnction is executed
* mean1 and mean2  have equal run time because they perform the same operation
* it cannot be determined from the above data


## Lecture 5a

Of the following which is not a valid way to read R data in a technically correct format
```
a<-read.xml
b<-read.csv
c<-read.table
d<-read.dataframe
```

* a & d
* a & b
* c & d
* All are correct formats to read R data


## Lecture 5b

In the following code what do the three dots represent?
```
maxMinusMin <- function(v, ...) max(v, ...) - min(v, ...)
apply(A, 1, maxMinusMin, na.rm=TRUE)
```

* Any additional parameter can be passed to the function but function is valid
* Function is invalid and cannot be executed
* It's an invalid function that will need more parameters
* Typing error

## Lecture 6a

In the following structure of data frame , what is one of the ways to query for the 
date
```
str(result)
'data.frame':   316125 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ ID    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ dt    : Date, format: "1999-12-31" "1999-12-31" "1999-12-31" "1999-12-31" ...
 $ Ticker: chr  "0111145D US" "0113357D US" "0202445Q US" "0203524D US" ...
 $ px    : num  32.5 20.6 34.2 21.4 11 ...
 $ High  : num  34.9 23.5 35.4 25.9 11 ...
 $ Low   : num  31.19 18 28.85 20.28 9.97 ...
```

* create new character version of the dt variable (chardt) and query in sqldf on the character version of dt sqldf("SELECT * FROM result WHERE chardt='1999-12-31'")
* query the table by using the command ("SELECT * FROM result WHERE dt=",as.Date("1999-12-31"),"", sep=""))
* query the table by using the command ("SELECT * FROM result WHERE dt="1999-12-31")
* Date is in an integer format  and cannot be searched

## Lecture 6b

which is/are the dplyr (may also use magrittr package) approach to search for a data point from a dataframe called 'flight' by 1st month and 1st DayofMonth
```
A<-flights[flights$Month==1 & flightsDayofMonth==1,]
B<-filter(flights, Month==1, DayofMonth==1)
C<-flights %>% select(Month==1) %>% select(DayofMOnth==1)
```


* B & C
* B
* C
* A

## Lecture 7a

The two most important properties of Tidyr package is :Each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Hence which statement is true

* It is easy to  describe functional relationships between columns than between rows
* It is easy to  describe functional relationships between rows than between columns
* Row and columns both are attributes of a dataframe , so each datapoint has a relationship with another datapoint across the dataframe
* All data points in a row are independent observations , hence there is no relationships even across a row in a dataframe

## Lecture 7b

In the following code what does the function xtab do ?

```
T_shirts <- data.frame(
  sex=sample(c("M","F"), 100, replace=T), 
	size=sample(c("L", "M", "S"), 100, replace=T)
)
table(T_shirts)
xtabs(~ sex + size, T_shirts)
```

* Crosstabulates variables with small numbers of unique values
* Introduces equally spaces tabs between columns in the output file
* Eliminates duplicate data in a table and merges data
* Breaks one data  frame into separate dataframes depending on the arguments that are passed to to xtab
