## Lecture 1a
  
What is the type of variable 'd' below 

```
f <- sqrt
x <- 1:20
y <- f(x)
z <- x^2
d <- data.frame(x, y, z)

```
* list
* matrix
* integer
* character



## Lecture 1b

Consider the following code:
```
N <-10000
x <- runif(N)
y <- runif(N)
vlength<-sqrt<-(x^2 +y^2)
in_circle<-vlength < 1

```

what appears to be  the correct output of the command

```
head(as.integer(in_circle))
```
* 1 1 1 1 1 0
* TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 
* 1 -1 1 0 -1 0
* 0.23, ,0.34, 0.12, 0.45, 0.55, 0.79



## Lecture 2a

What does the Central Limit Theorem state ?

* The distribution of the means of a set of random samples is approximately    Normal
* The area under the normal denisty curve is one
* Measures of central tendency should always be computed with and without        outliers
* Confidence intervals have zero margin of error for large sample sizes.



## Lecture 2b

 Probability mass function is same as probability density function. what type of functions are they

* False, the probability mass function is a discrete distribution and the probability density function is a continuous distribution
* True, they both are continuous distribution
* True, they both are discrete distribution
* False, the probability mass function is a continuous distribution and the probability density function is a discrete distribution

## Lecture 3a

In the following code
```
A <- matrix(1:4, nrow=1)
```
what is the result and type of

```
A%*%t(A)

```

* 5 and integer
*     [,1] [,2]  and list
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    2    4
  
* A^2 and double
* A(inv) and integer


## Lecture 3b
Consider the eigen equation
If A is the identity matrix. what is lambda?

* lamba is equal to 1
* lambda is infinity
* lambda is zero value
* lamda  doesn't exist for an identity matrix

## Lecture 4a

Consider the following code:
```
a <- function(x) x = 1/{
    1 + x
}
f <- function(x) x = 1/(1 + x)
g <- function(x) x = (1/(1 + x))
h <- function(x) x = ((1/(1 + x)))

x <- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)
comp <- microbenchmark(a(x), f(x), g(x), h(x), times = 1e+05)
comp
```
All the above perform the same function but have different levels of bracket or curly braces. would it affect the performance cost and which will be the fastest ? 
(Hint: R treats curly brackets as a “special” operator, whose arguments are not automatically evaluated, but it treats parentheses as a “built in” operator whose arguments (just one for parentheses) are evaluated automatically, with the results of this evaluation stored in a  list)

* a will be the fastest because it has curly braces
* f will be fastest because it has paranthesis
* all the operations have the same time because it is the same function and braces or parnatheses does not matter
* h will be fastest because you are simmplifying the function by adding layers of parantheses

## Lecture 4b

Consider the following code:

```
mean1 <- function(x) mean(x)
mean2 <- function(x) sum(x) / length(x)
x <- runif(100)
stopifnot(all.equal(mean1(x), mean2(x)))
microbenchmark(
  mean1(x),
  mean2(x)
)

```
his is because, among other reasons, mean(x) makes two passes over the vector to be more numerically accurate
In this code do mean 1 and mean 2 have equal run time or differ?

* mean 1 is considerably slower  because  mean1 makes two passes over the vector to be more numerically accurate
* mean 2 is considerably faster because just one inbuilt fnction is executed
* mean 1 and mean2  have equal run time because they perform the same operation
* it cannot be determined from the above data


## Lecture 5a

Of the following which is not a valid way to read R data in a technically correct format
```
a<-read.xml
```
```
b<-read.csv
```
```
c<-read.table
```
```
d<-read.dataframe
```

* a & d
* a & b
* c & d
* a & d

## Lecture 5b

In the following code what do the three dots represent?
```
maxMinusMin <- function(v, ...) max(v, ...) - min(v, ...)
apply(A, 1, maxMinusMin, na.rm=TRUE)

`````
* Any additional parameter passed to the function
* Function is not valid and cannot be executed
* It's an incomplete function that will need more parameters
* Typing error
